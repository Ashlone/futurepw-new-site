      bio: `
      Dr Rubina Setlhare is a senior lecturer at the University of the Western Cape. She is a Senior Lecturer
      at the Department of Educational Psychology. Rubina focuses on community psychology, childhood
      development and psychological challenges to learning in her lecturing duties. Rubina supervises
      honours, masters and PhD research students. Rubina’s preferred research approach is action
      research, where existing community knowledge are integral to collaborative research. Rubina is
      committed to community-based projects which promote spaces for the voices of the disenfranchised
      to be heard. Rubina Setlhare is also a registered educational psychologist, working with clients from
      Cape Town and Johannesburg.
      Her professional framework for practice is aligned with her academic paradigm and research
      methodology, where practice and praxis are underpinned by a critical transformative lens. The
      motivation is to the expand on existing contextually relevant knowledge in the community and
      academia, for developing skills for addressing both current and new challenges that will arise.
      Rubina’s approach involves regular, deep reflection on real life situations to gain insights into the
      &#39;big picture&#39; by rethinking our individual and collective role in contributing to and thereafter
      addressing contextual realities for a sustainable way forward. Universities are encouraged to partner
      with communities for successful teaching and learning in these contexts: This allows collaborative
      enquiry towards creating new knowledge beneficial to all, while drawing on existing indigenous and
      academic knowledge. With this approach, clients living in difficult conditions are not pathologised or
      regarded as being in need of ‘saving’ by the ‘all-knowing’ Western trained (Global North)
      professional. Over the past 3 centuries, European and American beliefs and values have dominated
      the ‘healing’ field of Psychology, both in practice and in academia. Common South African mental
      health referrals suggest that this reality is not working for our communities. A suggested way
      forward is to support communities utilise existing assets for effective decision-making for
      implementing contextually-appropriate, scalable and sustainable programs through integrating past
      and present knowledge systems. Community-oriented initiatives will potentially provide insights into
      future practice for the unpredictable C21st.

                beyond traditional career guidance; it embodies the core
                principle of social justice. To reduce youth unemployment, we
                believe in constructing an equitable system, where high school
                learners of all backgrounds have equal opportunities. Our focus
                is on leveling the playing field, and eliminating the stifling

                school learners with knowledge and skills for informed career
                decisions, we empower them to overcome systemic barriers and
                transition seamlessly into higher education and the world of
                work. We are dedicated to leveling the playing field, ensuring
                that no one's potential is hindered due to socioeconomic
                disparities. Social justice isn't a buzzword; it's the bedrock

                equitable future for South Africa's youth. Your support can
